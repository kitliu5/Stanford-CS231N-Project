# Stanford-CS231N-Project
In this project, we used U-Net and Cycle-GAN architectures for colorizing sketch images. 

Preliminary results and discussions can be found in the project milestone report.

The implementation of U-Net is done by customizing https://github.com/kvfrans/deepcolor.git

The implementation of Cycle-Gan is done by customizing https://github.com/xhujoy/CycleGAN-tensorflow
